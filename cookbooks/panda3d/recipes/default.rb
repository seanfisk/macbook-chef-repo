# Using Panda3D may or may not also require installing NVIDIA's Cg toolkit
# <https://developer.nvidia.com/cg-toolkit>. Unfortunately, it uses a
# .app-based installer that just runs a shell script with a tarball in the
# background. In addition, since it might not be used on every machine, we'll
# avoid automating it for now. But it at least deserves mention here.
